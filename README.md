Android Slider Preference Library
=================================

![A dialog-based preference that provides slider widget functionality. Useful for settings where the range of values are not discrete and fall along a continuum. This preference will store a float between 0.0 and 1.0 in the SharedPreferences.](https://raw.github.com/jayschwa/AndroidSliderPreference/master/screenshot.png)

## Overview

* Slider saves its value as a `float`
  * Access with `SliderPreference.getValue()` or [`SharedPreferences.getFloat()`][shar]
  * Basic implementation has a linear scale ranging between `0.0` and `1.0`, and produces values suitable for use as addends
  * Alternate implementation has a logarithmic scale ranging from `0.1` to `10.0`, and produces values suitable for use as multipliers
* Supports multiple summaries (e.g. "Low", "Medium", "High") and selects one based on the slider's position
  * Java: `SliderPreference.setSummary(CharSequence[] summaries)`
  * XML: `android:summary="@array/string_array_of_summaries"`
  * A single `String` still works too
* Subclass of [`DialogPreference`][diag]
  * Supports all [dialog-specific attributes][datr] such as `android:dialogMessage`
  * Visually-consistent with Android's built-in preferences
  * Less error-prone than displaying the slider directly on the settings screen

## How To Use

### Android Studio
#### Using Maven
1. Step: Add this to your root build.gradle
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		// [...]
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}

}
```
2. Step: Add the dependency to your project build.gradle
```
dependencies {
    // [...]
    compile 'com.github.jayschwa:AndroidSliderPreference:1.0'
}
```
#### Using a Module

1. Paste or clone this library into the `/libs` folder, in the root directory of your project. Create a new folder: `/libs` if not already present.  (This step is not required - only for keeping cleaner project structure)

2. Edit `settings.gradle` by adding the library. You have also define a project directory for the library. Your `settings.gradle` should look like below:

    ```
    include ':app', ':SliderPreference'
    project(':SliderPreference').projectDir = new File('libs/SliderPreference')
    ```

3. In `app/build.gradle` add the SliderPreference library as a dependency:

    ```
    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'
        compile project(":SliderPreference")
    }
    ```

4. Sync project, clean and build. You can use the SliderPreference as part of your project now.

### Eclipse

Before you can add a `SliderPreference` to your application, you must first add a library reference:

1. Clone or download a copy of the library
2. Import the library into Eclipse: File menu -> Import -> Existing Project into Workspace
3. Open your application's project properties and [add a library reference][ref] to "SliderPreference"

### Add a slider to your application

``` XML
<!-- preferences.xml -->
<net.jayschwa.android.preference.SliderPreference
    android:key="my_slider"
    android:title="@string/slider_title"
    android:summary="@array/slider_summaries"
    android:defaultValue="@string/slider_default"
    android:dialogMessage="@string/slider_message" />
```
``` XML
<!-- strings.xml -->
<string name="slider_title">Temperature</string>
<string-array name="slider_summaries">
    <!-- You can define as many summaries as you'd like -->
    <!-- The active summary will reflect the preference's current value -->
    <item>Freezing</item> <!-- 0.00 to 0.25 -->
    <item>Chilly</item>   <!-- 0.25 to 0.50 -->
    <item>Warm</item>     <!-- 0.50 to 0.75 -->
    <item>Boiling</item>  <!-- 0.75 to 1.00 -->
</string-array>
<item name="slider_default" format="float" type="string">0.5</item>
<string name="slider_message">Optional message displayed in the dialog above the slider</string>
```

It is possible to define the default value directly in the attribute. The summary can also be a regular string, instead of a string array:

``` XML
<net.jayschwa.android.preference.SliderPreference
    android:summary="This summary is static and boring"
    android:defaultValue="0.5" />
```

## Background

Sliders are recommended by Android's official [design documentation][ptrn] for specific types of settings:

> Use this pattern for a setting where the range of values are not discrete and fall along a continuum.
>
> ![Slider design pattern example](https://developer.android.com/design/media/settings_slider.png)

Despite this recommendation, the Android SDK does not actually provide a [`Preference`][pref] with slider functionality. Various custom implementations can be found around the web, but many have issues such as:

* The slider is displayed directly on the settings screen
  * Higher chance of accidental clicks
  * No way to confirm or cancel potential changes
* Discrete values are displayed to the user
  * Not ideal for this design pattern

This library aims to be as consistent as possible with the design pattern and Android's built-in [`Preference`][pref] implementations.
